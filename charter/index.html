<h1 id="title">DRAFT Mongolian  Layout Task Force Charter</h1>
<p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of this task
  force is to document issues and requirements for the layout and
  presentation of text in languages written in the Traditional Mongolian script,
  when those languages are used by Web standards and technologies,
  such as HTML, CSS, SVG, Mobile Web, Digital Publications and
Unicode. </p>
<p class="mission"> The Traditional Mongolian script is used by various communities in
  north and east Asia, speaking different languages,
  and participation in this work by those communities is welcomed.
  This task force will gather and integrate feedback from the
  participating members about the need for and technical
feasibility of various requirements.</p>
<p class="mission">The Task Force is part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/i18n-ig/">Internationalization Interest Group</a>.</p>

<p class="mission">The aim of this task force is to follow the example of previous layout task forces, and collect information about specific use cases for technologies
  defined in various Web specifications as they relate to the
  aforementioned scripts. The Task Force will report the results of its
  activities as a group back to the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/i18n-wg/">Internationalization Working Group</a>,
  as well as to other relevant groups and to the W3C membership and
community.</p>

<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The main objective of the task force is to document
  typographic and layout requirements for languages using the
  Traditional Mongolian script on the Web and in digital publications. These requirements should be met in Web
  standards and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, SVG, and
Digital Publication technologies.</p>
<p>An important starting point for the group will be to investigate current gaps in support for Mongolian on the Web, and produce documentation about that. Those findings will then be motivators for the creation of a document that describes the requirements for Mongolian support. Those requirements will describe how the Mongolian should script work, without reference to specific technologies (those references belong in the gap analysis outputs).</p>
<p>Several languages use the Traditional Mongolian script. The initial focus of this task force will be on the script as used for Mongolian in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia. @@@</p>
<p>In addition to those specifications, the group may do the following: 
  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer questions for the Internationalization WG and other W3C WGs related to the implementation of Mongolian support in specifications and implementations.</li>
  <li>Review W3C specifications, especially CSS, to ensure that Traditional Mongolian is adequately supported.    </li>
<li>Create tests to support documentation of gaps and to help check implementations.</li>
<li>Translate W3C resources into Mongolian.</li>
</ul>
<p>The public-i18n-mongolian mailing list is already in use by a number of Mongolian and Unicode experts for discussions related to Mongolian variation selectors, and the appropriate model for encoding Mongolian in Unicode. Those discussions will run alongside the work of this task force, and will only be incorporated into it if all parties feel this is advantageous.</p>
<h3>Initial set of languages</h3>
<p>Initial set of languages to be covered consists of Mongolian.
  Information regarding other languages will be included based
on the availability of linguistic and typographic experts.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>The Mongolian Text Layout Task Force will not produce Recommendation-track deliverables but will produce documents that can be published by the Internationalization Working Group as Working Group Notes.</p>
<p>The  main deliverables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A preliminary report describing the results of a gap analysis, assessing support for the Traditional Mongolian script on the Web. This preliminary version can be produced quickly with a small number of experts. The information will be added to the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html">W3C language matrix</a>.</li>
<li>A more detailed version of the gap analysis report, preferably with test cases and links to existing requirements information. After an initial effort, this information may be added to on an ongoing basis as new issues arise, or as gaps are closed. The results will again be reflected in the W3C language matrix.</li>
<li>A document describing requirements for  Mongolian text layout and presentation on the Web.</li>
</ul>
<p>The format of the deliverables must conform to standard formats developed across the W3C language enablement work, so that the work can be integrated into the larger picture. The wider W3C framework into which this work fits is described in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-discuss/wiki/Analysing-support-for-text-layout-on-the-Web">Analysing support for text layout on the Web</a>.</p>
<p>Technology-specific information about Mongolian support should be included in the gap analysis resources, not in the layout requirements document. The latter should just describe how Mongolian is expected to work, in a technology agnostic way, so that it is enduringly relevant.</p>
<p>The group may also choose to produce other non-normative deliverables, such as test cases and error reports â€“ under the terms of the Policies for Contribution of Test Cases to W3C, and in coordination with any relevant working groups.</p>
<p>Documents may be produced in Mongolian or Chinese, but must be translated into English. The English version will be the authoritative version at the W3C. English snapshots of the document must be produced at regular intervals, so that the international community is able to review and comment on the work in progress.</p>
<h3>Milestones</h3>

<p>Plans for the main document deliverable are as follows.</p>

<p>Other deliverables may be produced on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the charter, and the specific topics to be addressed by the task force and schedule information cannot be determined far in advance, but are driven by the needs of the Web community.</p>
</div>

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

<p>The success of the Task Force will be evaluated based on how
  productively it engages with W3C members and the relevant
  script communities to promote discussion of specifications
  that affect layout and presentation of languages on the Web,
  and how effectively it is able to produce additional documents
  for the refinement, implementation, and adoption of text
layout and related technologies in Mongolian.</p>
</div>

<div class="dependencies">
<h2 id="coordination">Relationships to External Groups</h2>

<p>Working Drafts and Notes will be published by the i18n WG, and the i18n WG will work with the task force closely to assist with development and review of the documents.</p>

</div>

<div class="participation">
<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

<p>To be successful, the Mongolian Text Layout Task Force is
  expected to need participation, for its duration, from a
  representative section of the typographic and digital text
  publishing communities for each of the main languages covered.
  Effective participation in the Mongolian Layout Task Force
is expected to consume up to one work day per week for  editors, and less for other group participants.</p>
<p>Participants are reminded of the <a
href="/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing">Good
Standing requirements</a> of the W3C Process.</p>
<p>People contributing substantive text to the deliverables must be public invited experts or work for W3C member organizations, in order to meet the policy requirements of section 7 of this charter.</p>
Participants who join the Mongolian Layout Task Force must also agree to the following:

<h3>Copyright</h3>

<p>Copyright is a very important part of standardization activities. It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.</p>
<p>In the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.</p>
<p> Task Force Participants  grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.</p>
<p>Nothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C. </p>
<h3>Decency</h3>
<p>The Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants.  The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria">Section 3.1 of the Process Document</a> applies. </p>
<p>The Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups. </p>


</div>

<div class="communication">
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>Mongolian Layout Task Force discussions take place via  github, teleconferences and email, and face-to-face meetings may be called at locations
  that are convenient to participants in the project. Any
  publications or other reports eventually contributed by the
  Task Force back to the W3C will be made available in English.
  (Translations may be produced in addition to the English
  version, but the English version will remain the authoritative
version.)</p>
<p>The task force reaches out to the wider international
  community with discussions and announcements in English on the public-i18n-mongolian@w3.org list (<a
            href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-mongolian/">archive</a>).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  That list will be used for technical discussions, where
  necessary, but the group will use github issues to handle most
technical or editorial comments and discussions. Daily and weekly digests of issues in the mlreq GitHub repository are posted to www-international@w3.org and public-i18n-core@w3.org, respectively.</p>
<p>The public-i18n-mongolian@w3.org list must archive or point to
  minutes and summaries of all teleconferences and face-to-face
  meetings. Meeting minutes will list all attendees at a given
meeting.</p>
<p>An administrative list, public-i18n-mlreq-admin, will also be
  used for internal communication about practical matters, such
  as meeting agenda, which should be published before each
teleconference or face-to-face meeting.</p>

<p>The group will use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/"> Internationalization Activity home page </a> and <a
href="https://www.chinaw3c.org/"> W3C China Website </a>to provide updated public information about its activities.
</p>
<p> Information about the group (deliverables, participants,
  face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available
  from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization
    
    
    
    
    
    Working Group</a> home page and from the <a
            href="https://w3c.github.io/mlreq/homepage/">home
      
      
      
      
      
      page of the Task Force</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="decisions">
<h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

<p>As explained in the Process Document (<a
href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>),
this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. In cases where there is a need to formally produce a group resolution about a particular issue, its Chair will put a question about the issue to the group and gather responses (including any formal objections); then, after due consideration of all the responses, the Chair will record a group resolution (possibly after a formal vote and also along with responding to any formal objections).</p>
</div>

<div class="patent">
<h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Policy </h2>

<p>Participants in the Mongolian Text Layout Task Force are obligated to comply with W3C patent-disclosure policy as outlined out inÂ <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section 6</a>Â of the W3C Patent Policy document. Although the Mongolian Text Layout Task Force is not chartered to produce Recommendation-track documents that themselves require patent disclosure, participants in the group are nevertheless obligated to comply with W3C patent-disclosure policy for any Recommendation-track specifications that they review or comment on.</p>
